- Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed
- Must have a polished frontend / UI
- Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)

- Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)
- Must use Bootstrap or Alternative CSS Framework

## Technologies Used
- jQuery for DOM manipulation
- AJAX for API GET requests
- Bootstrap
- HTML/CSS
- Firebase
- YouTube API
- Giphy API

## Code Explanation
- User enters search queries to add songs onto the mixtape (YouTube API), which then loads the first result in an iFrame player
- Result is pushed up onto Firebase as a song object, saving pertinent information which will be retrieved later
- Event listeners dynamically add songs and any user-added notes to the UI
- Ability to add notes, GIFs from Giphy, and external images through separate buttons
- Modals will then pop up for adding GIFs and external images
